BeanBroadcaster is an app designed to simultaneously controll multiple BlueBeans with a flatter and denser interface. It started as a debugging tool for a preject I'm working on as well as a means for practicing app development in swift. Comments, critiques, suggestions, and help are welcome. If I can get it cleaned up, prettied up, and feature filled enough I may attempt to submit it to the app store as a free app for people whose Bean apps are better served by it.

Upcoming Goals
Next major goal: flesh out management/config view with access to bean management options, trying to expose most features available in the library.
    Try to add upload of firmware or sketches if possible.
    Layout needs to be fixed for different sized iphones.
    Add dropdowns for more details in management page. -- Alternative is to make second view a normal view focused on a single beans details.


for 0.22: more cleanup
    fix read for multiple beans
    swipe to forget bean?
    experiment with interface for individual bean management

mid .2s: implement type changing (with different keyboards?)
    option for affixing trailing character
    reimplement scratch reading so that read values are stored in each bean's bean container

-notes: consider removing either "Broadcast" or "Send Button" now that selection table is implemented
        read should read multiple beans, but nil read protection should be added first if possible
        change connection label on BeanSelectionCell to a button which attempts connection if disconnect? should still require going to config to turn off connection flag?
            add count to connection indicator at top also (x/beanList.count)


///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
v0.21
Some deprecated functions removed
global autoconnect toggle option removed for now. Will be true until reimplemented
"Send" button removed since broadcast does everything now
--Reconsidering use of tableview for management view


///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
v0.2
Project, directories, everything renamed to BeanBroadcaster. New git started

///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
v0.17
Management tableview trivially implemented, displaying names of discovered beans.

///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
v0.16
-Broadcast target selection TableView implemented
-Broadcast button now calls sendDataToSelectedBeans, sending only to selected beans

///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
v0.15
-Updated to Bean iOS SDK version 0.52
-Code tweaks associated with above to regain proper functionality

///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
v0.14
-slight tweaks to interface, storyboard in preparation for next major changes
-updatelist button renamed, moved. Still toggling autoconnect for now but will eventually launch management view
-type button added, connected but only toggling placeholder dummy



///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
v0.13
-autoreconnect on dc enabled
-additional global autoConnect variable added. Toggled with UpdateList button for now.
-BeanContainer class now contained in beanList, also contains broadcast target flag and autoconnect flag
-Code refactored to support BeanContainer. Autoconnecting to all for now
-ScratchData now has a pseudo class variable containing a trailing digit/char to be added for unique transmissions using strToDataWithTrail() class fcn.



////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

v0.12
-Some code cleanup and beanList compliance
-several functions hardcoded to use beanList[0] until selector is added- these should later be updated to work on a list of beans
-refactoring to add checkGobalConnectionStatus() to update connection status label
-Interface and buttons renamed for clarity. Broadcast added, updatelist now unused
-ScratchData struct now carries associated bean. Associated functions updated to use it. A manager for multiple scratchData's is now needed. I could swap out use of timer and have something autorun on scratch update. This might require a list or queue of requests though.



-should add a random trailing char when sending to bean so it won't discard repeat messages-- add only to find(bean.name, "NDU/EDU") != nil
-fix for randomly appended chars awaiting better string slicing. Also the fix should take into account extra trailing char option above
-still crashing on empty scratch read-- problem with bean libraries


Future
-autoresize would be nice
-listview of some sort to select target beans
-add autoreconnect
-add menu or view for choosing beans to connect to or disconnect from
-add menu or view for choosing which beans to send to/receive from at a given time

///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

v 0.11
-Multiple connections and broadcast working!
-Need to finish replacing single bean var uses with beanList


remaining from v 0.1:
-Still randomly appending chars to returned messages from scratch
-May crash on reading empty scratch
-sizing of view elements is poor, not autoresizing

Next Steps:
-Finish refactoring for beanList
-Need to handle reading from multiple at once-> might want to build better version of ScratchData, or container for them- or extension to PTDBean?
-protection against calls to do stuff to discovered but disconnected beans
-add menu or view for choosing beans to connect to or disconnect from
-add menu or view for choosing which beans to send to/receive from at a given time

Look into:
Auto-reconnect to previously discovered device? -> add some timer logic in didDisconect function


////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

v 0.1 Issues:
-Still randomly appending chars to returned messages from scratch
-Autoconnecting, oblivious to other beans
-May crash on reading empty scratch
-sizing of view elements is poor, not autoresizing

-next steps:
convert ptdbean to array of [ptdbean], refactor
then test operating as normal

-add connect/disconnect button (connect to whatever is first in queue)

-add chooser of some sort (or active display of available beans)

-add ability to select bean and connect

--- Develop ability to connect to multiple beans at once
